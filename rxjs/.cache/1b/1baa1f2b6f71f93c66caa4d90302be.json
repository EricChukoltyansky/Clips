When the source emits a value,\n * the `delayDurationSelector` function is called with the source value as\n * argument, and should return an Observable, called the \"duration\" Observable.\n * The source value is emitted on the output Observable only when the duration\n * Observable emits a value or completes.\n * The completion of the notifier triggering the emission of the source value\n * is deprecated behavior and will be removed in future versions.\n *\n * Optionally, `delayWhen` takes a second argument, `subscriptionDelay`, which\n * is an Observable. When `subscriptionDelay` emits its first value or\n * completes, the source Observable is subscribed to and starts behaving like\n * described in the previous paragraph. If `subscriptionDelay` is not provided,\n * `delayWhen` will subscribe to the source Observable as soon as the output\n * Observable is subscribed.\n *\n * ## Example\n *\n * Delay each click by a random amount of time, between 0 and 5 seconds\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent, delayWhen, interval } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * const delayedClicks = clicks.pipe(\n *   delayWhen(() => interval(Math.random() * 5000))\n * );\n * delayedClicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n * @see {@link throttle}\n * @see {@link throttleTime}\n * @see {@link debounce}\n * @see {@link debounceTime}\n * @see {@link sample}\n * @see {@link sampleTime}\n * @see {@link audit}\n * @see {@link auditTime}\n *\n * @param {function(value: T, index: number): Observable} delayDurationSelector A function that\n * returns an Observable for each value emitted by the source Observable, which\n * is then used to delay the emission of that item on the output Observable\n * until the Observable returned from this function emits a value.\n * @param {Observable} subscriptionDelay An Observable that triggers the\n * subscription to the source Observable once it emits any value.\n * @return A function that returns an Observable that delays the emissions of\n * the source Observable by an amount of time specified by the Observable\n * returned by `delayDurationSelector`.\n */\nexport function delayWhen<T>(\n  delayDurationSelector: (value: T, index: number) => Observable<any>,\n  subscriptionDelay?: Observable<any>\n): MonoTypeOperatorFunction<T> {\n  if (subscriptionDelay) {\n    // DEPRECATED PATH\n    return (source: Observable<T>) =>\n      concat(subscriptionDelay.pipe(take(1), ignoreElements()), source.pipe(delayWhen(delayDurationSelector)));\n  }\n\n  return mergeMap((value, index) => delayDurationSelector(value, index).pipe(take(1), mapTo(value)));\n}\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"6d446ff57d85bdb2b5f8f3a01dc57b8a","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
